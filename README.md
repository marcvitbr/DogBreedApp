# 🐶 DogBreedsApp

An iOS app built with **SwiftUI**, **SwiftData**, and **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** that explores dog breeds using [The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/).  
This project was developed as part of a coding challenge for Sword Health.

## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Browse Dog Breeds**: Paginated list/grid of breeds, ordered alphabetically.  
- 🔍 **Search Breeds**: Search by name with detailed results (name, group, origin).  
- 📖 **Breed Details**: View category, origin, and temperament.  
- 🔄 **Tab Navigation**: Tab bar to switch between list and search.  
- 📡 **Offline Ready**: SwiftData integration for caching results locally.  
- 🛠️ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API/network errors.

## 🧩 Architecture

This project follows **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** pattern:

```
DogBreedsApp/
├── Sources/
│   ├── App/              # App entry, root reducer, tab navigation
│   ├── Core/             # Models, services, persistence, utils
│   ├── Features/         # Screens: List, Search, Detail
│   └── Resources/        # Assets, preview data
├── Tests/                # Unit tests for reducers & core logic
└── UITests/              # UI tests for navigation & flows
```

- **TCA** → Feature-first modularization, predictable state management.  
- **SwiftData** → Persistence layer for offline caching.  
- **SwiftUI** → Declarative UI for list, grid, search, and detail views.

## 🧪 Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Reducers and API clients under `Tests/`.  
- **UI Tests**: Navigation and screen interactions under `UITests/`.  
- Run all tests with:
  ```sh
  xcodebuild test -scheme DogBreedsApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
  ```
